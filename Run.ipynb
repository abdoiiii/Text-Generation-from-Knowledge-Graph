            "naive bayes -lrb- nb -rrb- is well-known to be a simple but effective CLASSIFIER , especially when combined with FEATURE SELECTION . unfortunately , FEATURE SELECTION METHODS are often greedy and thus can not guarantee an optimal feature set is selected . an alternative to FEATURE SELECTION is to use BAYESIAN MODEL averaging -lrb- BMA -rrb- , which computes a weighted average over multiple predictors ; when the different PREDICTOR MODELS correspond to different feature sets , BMA has the advantage over FEATURE SELECTION that its predictions tend to have lower variance on average in comparison to any single model . in this paper , we show for the first time that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER is possible to exactly evaluate BMA over the <unk> <unk> of NB FEATURE MODELS in linear-time in the number of FEATURES ; this yields an algorithm about as expensive to train as a single NB MODEL with all FEATURES , but yet provably converges to the GLOBALLY OPTIMAL FEATURE SUBSET in the ASYMPTOTIC LIMIT OF DATA . we evaluate this novel BMA-NB CLASSIFIER on a range of datasets showing that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER never <unk> nb -lrb- as expected -rrb- and sometimes offers performance competitive -lrb- or superior -rrb- to CLASSIFIERS such as SVMS and logistic regression while taking a fraction of the time to train . \n",
